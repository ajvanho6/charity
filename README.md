# Charity Drupal 8 theme

##Installation
This theme uses [Libsass](https://github.com/sass/libsass) to compile Sass files. Libsass can be easily installed on [Macs](https://github.com/sass/libsass/wiki/Building-on-Mac-OS-X) and is also available for [Windows](https://github.com/sass/libsass/wiki/Building-on-Windows). You should make sure you have Libsass installed before you proceed.

Next, install dependencies using npm by running the following command in the root of your theme folder:

`npm install` then

simply run `gulp` it is the same as running the build and watch commands in succession.

**Important Note:** The CSS file in libraries.yml is set to styles.css. This file is not minified and includes Sass maps for debugging. Before pushing your code to production, you should change libraries.yml so that it is set to styles.min.css. This file is automatically generated when you run `gulp build` and should already be available  for you to use.
